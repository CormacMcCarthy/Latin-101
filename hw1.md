The regular Latin verb has 4 principal parts.

The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. The first person singular form is used for the first and third principal parts.

The verb 'interficiō' is in the 2nd principle part and the verb 'faciō' is in the 1st principle part. They are identical in the sence that both verbs are part of the third conjugation (ĕre). In the other forms of these verbs, the endings are as follows: ō, ĕre, ī, and tus. 

Two verbs belonging to the 4th conjugation are audīre (audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītus) and venīre (veniō, venīre, vēnī, ventus). The 1st, 2nd and 4th principal parts are regular, but the 4th principal part has some irregularity as audīvī fluctuates from the ending seen in vēnī. 

The principal parts of the verbs capiō and faciō share identical endings in the principal parts (iō, ĕre, ī, and tus).
